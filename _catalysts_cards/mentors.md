    bio: >
      I’m Aggelos Bellos, a senior software engineer on the Architecture Team at Epignosis. My day-to-day revolves around advocating for Domain-Driven Design and Test-Driven Development. When I’m not (politely) annoying people about those, I’m usually doing the same by introducing new rules to our static analysis tools and CI pipeline. Beyond the code, I’m deeply fascinated by socio-technical systems—how social dynamics shape technical architectures, and how those architectures, in turn, influence teams. In my free time, I like to explore scalability challenges and design patterns, and I share my thoughts and solutions on my blog.

    title: Head of Engineering & Product, eFront

      I'm currently leading the Engineering and Product teams at eFront, a learning management system used globally in corporate and academic settings. My background combines software architecture, team leadership, and product strategy, with a focus on scalable systems, developer experience, and continuous delivery. I enjoy mentoring teams on how to turn ideas into impactful, well-engineered solutions and look forward to supporting the next generation of innovators during the hackathon.

      Holding a Computer Science degree. More than 15 years experience in developing internet services, more than 10 years working on and setting e-learning trends. Was having fun coding before Stack Overflow existed - let alone AI chatbots. Stretching agile methodologies to their limits. Latest hobby is getting lost in the labyrinth of modernizing legacy codebases.
