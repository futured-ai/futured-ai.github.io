My day-to-day revolves around advocating for Domain-Driven Design and Test-Driven Development. When I’m not (politely) annoying people about those, I’m usually doing the same by introducing new rules to our static analysis tools and CI pipeline. Beyond the code, I’m deeply fascinated by socio-technical systems—how social dynamics shape technical architectures, and how those architectures, in turn, influence teams. In my free time, I like to explore scalability challenges and design patterns, and I share my thoughts and solutions on my blog. </p> </div> <div class="judge-card card"> <div class="judge-header"> <img class="judge-photo" src="/assets/img/images/konstantinos.png" alt="Konstantinos Chatzinikolakis"> <div class="judge-info"> <h3 class="judge-name">Konstantinos Chatzinikolakis</h3> <p class="judge-title">Head of Engineering &amp; Product, eFront</p> </div> </div> <p class="judge-bio">I'm currently leading the Engineering and Product teams at eFront, a learning management system used globally in corporate and academic settings.
