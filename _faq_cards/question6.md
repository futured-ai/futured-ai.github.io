title: Do I need to have prior experience?
answer: >
  No, you absolutely do not need prior experience to participate in FuturEd AI. Hackathons are designed to be inclusive learning environments where people of all skill levels can collaborate, learn, and create. The focus is on the experience, teamwork, and learning process, rather than just the final product. So, even if you're a complete novice, you'll find welcoming and supportive mentors.
