title: Can I bring a pre-existing project?
answer: >
  No, you cannot bring a pre-existing project to FuturEd AI. The idea is to start a project from scratch during the event itself. The purpose of the hackathon is to foster innovation and collaboration within a limited timeframe, but as a team you can brainstorm, refine or change the original proposed solution. Also using pre-existing projects fails to ensure a level playing field for all participants.
