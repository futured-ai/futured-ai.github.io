answer: >
  The selection process of FuturEd AI involves an initial application phase where applicants submit their skills and project ideas. A review committee will evaluate these applications based on criteria such as technical proficiency, relevance to the theme, creativity, and potential impact. The most promising applicants, demonstrating a strong combination of these qualities, will be then invited to participate in the hackathon event.
